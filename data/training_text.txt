<s> <s> tl dr why is your cough during an upper respiratory infection not as bad as your post viral cough in the absence of asthma or secondary infection hey folks this question is perplexing me and i can't seem to find a specific answer via google. i think i understand why post viral cough happens in the first place your mucosa are already inflamed from the infection and immune response . your cough reflex is hypersensitive because it kicked into gear to fight the virus . as such the smallest irritations such as post nasal drip or cold air are far more likely to trigger a cough . this takes a while to calm down . what i don't understand is the severity and duration . post viral coughs can take way longer to clear than the virus or any other symptoms . and people often complain of their post viral cough being more frequent dry painful and disruptive than when they were sick. this has been my experience at least . sometimes i have a cold and barely cough at all . then as soon as my nose clears up coughing fits keep me awake at night for 2 weeks . and i have no comorbidities or secondary infections . so what's going on there is there like an inflammation cycle are my observations totally off -- edit thanks so much for these responses i want to clarify for people requesting dispensing medical advice please don't it's against the rules of the sub . my question is only about the irritating unpleasant cough that 1 happens after mild illness 2 your doctor tells you not to worry about and 3 goes away on its own. </s> </s>

<s> <s> black lives matter. the moderation team at askscience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community . this has gone on for too long and it's time for lasting change . when 1 out of every 1 000 black men and boys in the united states can expect to be killed by the police police violence is a public health crisis . black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men . in 2019 1 099 people were killed by police in the us 24% of those were black even though only 13% of the population is black. when black americans make up a disproportionate number of covid 19 deaths healthcare disparity is another public health crisis . in michigan black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of covid 19 deaths . in louisiana black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of covid 19 deaths . black americans are more likely to work in essential jobs with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers . they are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care. these disparities these crises are not coincidental . they are the result of systemic racism economic inequality and oppression . change requires us to look inward too . for over a decade askscience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists . our panel includes hundreds of stem professionals who volunteer their time and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non scientists . we are fully committed to making science more accessible and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in stem . however we must acknowledge that stem suffers from a marked lack of diversity . in the us black workers comprise 11% of the us workforce but hold just 7% of stem jobs that require a bachelor's degree or higher . only 4% of medical doctors are black . hispanic workers make up 16% of the us workforce 6% of stem jobs that require a bachelor's degree or higher and 4.4% of medical doctors . women make up 47% of the us workforce but 41% of stem professionals with professional or doctoral degrees . and while we know around 3.5% of the us workforce identifies as lgbtq+ their representation in stem fields is largely unknown. these numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines . for example as of 2019 less than 4% of tenured or tenure track geoscience positions are held by people of color and fewer than 100 black women in the us have received phds in physics. this lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the stem community as a whole . we cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism sexism and homophobia. it is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly . we must all stand together against police violence racism and economic social and environmental inequality . stem professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard to listen and to offer support . we must be the change . sources: disparities time of covid 19 workers coronavirus covid 19 in the stem workforce varies widely across jobs  019 0519 z progressive academics can be racist ive experienced it firsthand  issues stem diversity  </s> </s>

<s> <s> after reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system i saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation due to its magnetism . im not sure why i never queationed this before but as an amateur blacksmith i regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it. also i know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal. so i did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter neither of which i have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field i dont quite understand how it alone even if it were swirling could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core . i also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them. then i started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism. so i researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours and it doesn't. which brings me back to my original question only revised how is our inner core of iron plasma magnetic and why is important that it is iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow edit thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses . i really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity. the major points i have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat earths rotation radiation and even the moon . we are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet. does that kinda summ it up </s> </s>

<s> <s> i have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations 1 . the moon >u chlorophilia a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the earth in the form of our moon . simulations e.g . canup & asphaug 2001 cuk & stewart 2012 pdf and evidence from lunar stable isotopes e.g . wiechert et al . 2001 strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large possibly mars sized object collided with the proto earth about 4.5 billion years ago flinging out a vast amount of proto mantle and proto crustal material into space a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon. 2 . a moon rock which is actually an earth meteorite > u yellowstone10 some researchers have concluded that a 2 cm chip of a moon rock collected by the crew of apollo 14 was probably ejected from the earth about 4 billion years ago . earth rock found moon earth rock found moon > >u foramsgalorams in january of this year it was announced that a rock sample from apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from earth within it this would make it an earth meteorite which struck the moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock . this would have happened like a game of solar system pinball as it would take a large meteorite striking earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the moon . radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old so very early in earth's 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the theia earth impact event which formed the moon itself so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity . you can read more on the details here may have found an earth meteorite on the moon and the research paper was published in earth and planetary science letters here . 3 . moldavite - rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back > u aa unfiltered moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass . it formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level . is moldavite is moldavite 4 . hydrogen and helium >u slowerthanlightspeed jean's escape describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules escape#jeans\ escape escape#jeans escape > >atmospheric escape of hydrogen on earth is due to jeans escape \~10 40% charge exchange escape \~ 60 90% and polar wind escape \~ 10 15% currently losing about 3 kg s of hydrogen.\ 10\ the earth additionally loses approximately 50 g s of helium primarily through polar wind escape . escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller \ 10\ but a japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the earth.\ 11\ also volcanoes apparently do not have enough force to eject matter into space >u clovis69 volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a supervolcano is just a volcano thats bigger longer huge volumes of magma and gases to eject . most eruptions even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause destruction destruction > >u knowanuknow it's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space . the most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km sec . subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50 60 km high . not high enough since space is kinda sorta defined as starting at 100 km up . i thought krakatoa could do it since that volcano literally exploded shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of tnt . but even that isn't enough . it literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13 000 hiroshimas or 4 tsar bombs and even that isn't enough . there's something called a verneshot which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could in theory eject matter into sub orbital space but a verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed . thank you everyone for your answers . i could not mention everyone who gave actual answers with explanations and sources . i apologise for that. </s> </s>

<s> <s> hi reddit we are ece kartal u psecekartal sebastian schmidt u tsbschm and esther molina montes u memmontes . we are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non invasive and early detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples . ask us anything pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease although few people develop this form of cancer only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis . this is in part due to late detection symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention surgery and or chemotherapy . this makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease yet no approved non invasive or minimally invasive inexpensive tests currently exist. we studied a spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac the most common form of pancreatic cancer and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas an important risk factor for the development for pdac . we found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for pdac patients even in early stages . when combined with a blood serum based cancer progression not diagnostic marker prediction accuracy increased even further . we confirmed this finding in an independent german cohort and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict pdac among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases . moreover we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth pancreatic healthy tissue pancreatic tumors and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators. our study is freely available online in the journal gut kartal schmidt molina montes et al 2022 2021 324755 a commentary by r . newsome and c . jobin in the same issue puts our work into context 2021 326710 for less formal introductions check the press releases by one of our funding bodies worldwide cancer research opinion 2022 march microorganisms in stool samples could offer new way to detect pancreatic cancer early  or the lead institutions embl heidelberg germany international study proposes stool analysis for early detection of pancreatic cancer  and cnio madrid spain text in spanish colaboracion internacional propone un analisis de heces para la deteccion temprana del cancer de pancreas  . our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts . yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive non invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer . such a screen could initially target risk groups e.g . above a certain age or with a family history of pdac . ideally with further development and in combination with other biomarkers our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future . that said none of us is a medical doctor we cannot and will not provide any medical advice and none of what we post here should be construed as such. we will be on at noon eastern 16 ut and are looking forward to your questions aua who we are: + dr . ece kartal u psecekartal twitter @ps ecekartal ecekartal is a former phd student at the european molecular biology laboratory embl in heidelberg germany and currently a postdoctoral researcher at the university of heidelberg. + dr . thomas sebastian schmidt u tsbschm twitter @tsbschm is a research scientist at the embl in heidelberg. + dr . esther molina montes u memmontes is a former postdoctoral researcher at the spanish national cancer research center cnio in madrid spain and currently an assistant professor at the university of granada spain. </s> </s>

<s> <s> i'm a stem cell biologist and director of the ucsf diabetes center . my lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease . we just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature functional insulin producing cells made from stem cells . read more here my lab focuses on type 1 diabetes t1d which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas . currently the only cure for t1d is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant but these options are only available to the sickest patients who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives. one of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells . they sit in the pancreas an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies that is hard to access in living people . we can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells . therefore one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells how they function under normal conditions how they deteriorate in diabetes and how one can possibly fix them . by producing working beta cells in the lab we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies . down the line we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as crispr to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression. i'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions . i'll be starting at 9am pst 12 et 16 ut . ama edit i am signing off now thank you for all the thoughtful questions and comments </s> </s>

<s> <s> i've noticed that if there's a mosquito in the room and i swat at it but fail to kill it it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again. i'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are . for example does it actually have a behavior like if swatted at lay low for 30 minutes before trying again or am i just imagining the correlation second if they do have a hide behavior do they choose predictable locations do they prefer corners of the room areas with less light do they even use light in making their decisions do they go low to the ground high on the ceiling do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot it seems like i usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white well lit wall it would be a lot easier to hunt them down . this correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play though so i'm curious if much is known on this topic. edit thank you for the lovely replies so far i just wanted to clarify that i'm not actually that interested in \where\ mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense i'm more interested in how and why they make their decisions.. . like which senses do they use most vision smell touch and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs . hiding or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey then go for an attack edit 2 well this post blew up you may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard.. . sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies . the vast majority of replies were either 1 personal tips for hunting mosquitoes or 2 personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide . precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article thank you  u hillsbottom showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors and then avoid the source of those odors people in the future. i didn't feel satisfied so i spent a few hours trawling the literature.. . turns out there's simply no research on this topic we know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior . it's not even clear whether there exists a hiding behavioral program or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction aversion biases in response to swats etc . however after reading up on it i do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned . it turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \~2 4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs they typically repeat this hunt rest cycle \~3 4 times before they die . furthermore a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed so in reality it typically only feeds on 1 5 people before stopping . therefore even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans less than 10 in its life cycle and over the course of only a few days . that isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to learn with . so if the possible answers to my original question are 1 it's random 2 they have instinct driven preferences for hiding with a lot of variation between regions species or 3 they learn where to hide from experience we can probably rule out #3. &#x200b &#x200b </s> </s>

<s> <s> this is probably a very stupid question but google does not seem to help at all and it's been bugging me for the last 2 hours . the title is a very shortened and simplified version of my question so let me explain it in more detail. for example a obviously homozygous blonde man and a homozygous dark haired woman had a female child . the daughter would be again obviously heterozygous hair color wise meaning she has one allele coding light hair from her father and another one coding dark hair from her mother . by the laws of probably highly simplified genetics the daughter would have inhairited dark hair as the dark hair allele is the dominant one in her genotype . however as i understand to make sure both famale and male organisms have roughly the same level of gene expression in both sexes random one of the x chromosomes in female organisms gets inactivated . now back to the whole cat fiasco . i was reading about tortoiseshell cats and everything made perfect sense to me . since one of the cat's x chromosome located alleles codes for orange hair and another variation of it codes for black and one gets inactivated with basically a 50 50 chance the cats fur presents as a black orange mosaic depending on the pigment amount pigment variation coded in a specific cell . back to our heterozygous daughter . why isn't her hair a blonde black mosaic if the chromosome inactivated was inharited from her mother the strand should be blonde and vice versa. now i do have some theories about why that doesn't happen . for once this overly simplified model of hair color inharitance is basically high school level genetics so i'm sure someone's true hair color is determined by a variation of many genes . another explenation would be the hair color genes only being situated on the 23rd pair in cats . unfortunately this just raised more questions in me . it can't only be cats then right does any other mammal have this fur variation or something analogical it also can't possibly only affect hair color surely there are other alleles on the sex chromosomes that would fit into this weird expression loophole . while answering try not to be to rough . i'm only just out of high school and about to re take my finals . i'm very passionate about biology and so interested in genetics but sometimes i just don't completely understand . hope i got the terminology right my polish high school offered an english speaking biology class but the teacher actually didn't speak any english and she would just resort to handing out some english homework she stole of the web lol. </s> </s>

<s> <s> playing some kids' geometric puzzle pieces and then doing some pencil & paper checks i realized something. it started like this i can line up a sequence of pentagons and equilateral triangles end to end and get a cycle a segmented circle . there are 30 shapes in this cycle 15 pentagon triangle pairs and so the perimeter of the cycle is divided then into 30 equal straight segments. here is a figure to show what i'm talking about you can do something similar with squares and triangles and you get a smaller cycle 6 square pentagon pairs dividing the perimeter into 12 segments. and then you can just build it with triangles basically you just get a hexagon with six sides. for regular polygons beyond the pentagon it changes . hexagons and triangles gets you a straight line actually you can get a cycle out of these but it isn't of segments like all the others . then you get cycles bending in the opposite direction with 8 9 12 15 and 24 gons . for those respectively the perimeter now the 'inner' boundary of the pattern see the figure above for an example is divided into 24 18 12 10 and 8 segments. you can also make cycles with some polygons on their own triangles squares hexagons three hexagons in sequence make a cycle and you can do it a couple of ways with octagons with four or eight . you can also make cycles with some other combinations e.g . 10 edited from 5 pentagon square pairs . here's what i realized: the least common multiple of those numbers the number of segments to the perimeter of the triangle polygon circle is 360 at least i'm pretty sure of it. . maybe here i have made a mistake . this means that if you lay all those cycles on a common circle and if you want to subdivide the circle in such a way as to catch the edges of every segment you need 360 subdivisions. am i just doing some kind of circular reasoning numerology here or is this maybe a part of the long lost rationale for the division of the circle into 360 degrees the wikipedia article claims it's not known for certain but seems weighted for a it's close to the # of days in the year explanation and also nods to the fact that 360 is such a convenient number can be divided lots and lots of ways which seems related to what i noticed . surely i am not the first discoverer of this pattern. . in fact this seems like something that would have been easy for an ancient mesopotamian to discover.. edit for tldr for those who don't understand the explanation above i sympathize to be clear this method gets you exactly 360 subdivisions of a circle but it has nothing to do with choice of units . it's a coincidence not a tautology as some people are suggesting. . i thought it was an interesting coincidence because the method relies on constructing circles or cycles out of elementary geometrical objects regular polyhedra . the most common response below is basically what wikipedia says i.e . common knowledge 360 is a highly composite number divisible by the babylonian 60 and is close to the number of days in the year so that probably is why the number was originally chosen . but i already recognized these points in my original post. . what i want to know is whether or not this coincidence has been noted before or proposed as a possible method for how the b's came up with 360 even if it's probably not true. thanks </s> </s>

<s> <s> i've been trying to delve deeper into chemistry & physics lately and one thing i've learned about is electromagnetism and strong force . to my current understanding protons and generally things with opposing charges repel one another . this alone would cause protons to fly away from one another until nuclear strong force comes in . if i'm not mistaken nuclear strong force is the force between particles in a nucleus that allows them to be bound together all particles have this property but neutrons to protons is the most important example as it allows a neutron to bind to two protons effectively holding the two together . my subsequent question is then obvious if particles bind to each other and the neutral force of a neutron means there's no electromagnetic force separating them why don't massive amounts of neutrons accumulate among each other over time creating a mega neutron ball &#x200b i'm assuming that this question also relates to another question of mine that being why can't i just bombard unstable isotopes of massive atoms such as oganesson with neutrons until the strong force granted by them eventually overpowers the immense electromagnetic force of all the protons . as they're both the same question of why doesn't infinitely adding neutrons to a nucleus make it infinitely more stable. </s> </s>

<s> <s> let me lead off by saying i am aware of the equation for this . i'm confused by some of the details . i've been trying to learn a thing or two about rocket engines and i'm struggling to pick apart this particular question. so in the combustion chamber you've got an initial temperature and pressure etc . which are basically a function of the reactants you are using . these determine the area of the throat which is sized so that you get sonic flow at that choke point . you need the a\ that gives m=1 at the throat. but i'm confused about what determines the shape and size of the nozzle after that.. . here's a few things i do understand: the propellant shifts to supersonic after the throat . velocity increases as the area expands. temperature and pressure drop as velocity increases. ideally you want the pressure at exit to be equal to ambient pressure . this is mainly about efficiency the exact shape and length isn't super important . it's mostly just about weight and cost. i guess it's that third point is perhaps what has me confused . when i look at the equation for thrust there's two terms: 1 . mass flow rate \ exit velocity 2 . exit area \ pressure difference from ambient let me assume a fixed mass flow rate . the equation for exit velocity is.. . basically a function of exit pressure . the other terms are basically all coming directly from your choice of fuel oxidizer and other initial conditions . the exact term where it appears is `1 pe p0` so i think what that's saying is the ideal is zero exit pressure the higher your exist pressure is to the initial pressure at combustion the less energy you've gotten out of it . and lower exit pressure ultimately requires a larger nozzle exist area. but then if the exit pressure is too low you start to suffer from the second term . because if exit pressure is lower than ambient this term goes negative. am i right in understanding that this is the tricky balance you need to strike and shooting for pe=pa is where it happens to be optimized for thrust </s> </s>

<s> <s> now dont get me wrong i'm no career scientist . but i've got a taxonomical genetic hypothesis to foot and i want to see if i'm mistaken or not . assuming of course that a subspecies is as defined a a taxonomic category that ranks below species usually a fairly permanent geographically isolated race is it possible for the human race to be divided into taxonomical subspecies i know the human race is divided along many superficial physiological borders between black and white and orthognathy and prognathy etc . and that these features have little isolated bearing as oftentimes they can appear in populations quite distant to one another often to the dismay of phenotypists . however there are many features unique to what used to be highly isolated populations . for example the people who historically populated and continue to populate the himalayas are known to have larger hemoglobin than most other cultural isolates helping them dissolve and absorb oxygen more efficiently at higher altitudes . furthermore the peoples of central africa have a specialized susceptibility to sickle celled anaemia which in turn reduces and in some cases even eliminates their risk of contracting malaria from mosquito vectors . even the germanic people of northern europe are in their own way specialized having the most lactose tolerant individuals per capita in the world thanks to their naturally developed capability to produce large quantities of the enzyme lactase . these populations standing as examples i believe it is possible to divide the archaic cultural isolates prior to today's heavily interconnected society into human taxonomical subspecies and i wanted to see the reddit science communities opinion on whether this was viable or not . if the mods think this question is best placed in another subreddit please by all means let me know and i will post it there instead . thanks for all your time. </s> </s>

<s> <s> so this is going to be my first reddit post and hopefully you guys and gals can help me out. the other day i heard a noise coming from my computer it was the warning alert indicating that someone on the internet was wrong . i therefore engaged in a brief discussion with someone who advocates geocentrism . never having been exposed to this seriously outside of history classes about galileo copernicus and having a computer science background i didn't feel well equipped to debate this strident person who was apparently free of any doubt. still curious however i have since been trying to figure out what the consensus is on the data re:geocentrism. as far as i could understand he's stating that the mm experiments morley experiment the cmb data from wmap and ssds observational evidence shows.html and just recently the planck data principle 1532 2013 rip why.html all point to the earth as being a privileged non relativistic frame. i've checked out plait's response seriously #.uuycxhxwpog to some non specific geocentrist claims and incedentally delano's friend's response to it . i have also watched the 4 extant videos created by chl feature=player embedded&v=wyrjzbnmc7u# as well as various wikipedia rationalwiki pages etc... but i was hoping for specific refutations of the things linked above mmx and cmb information . i realize that this guy is a fundamentalist and as such isn't susceptible to the kind of reason that sways me but i would like to get a better grasp on the size and scope of his wrongness . edit so first of all thanks to all those who took the time and effort to give responses to my original questions many of them were very informative . as my first experience posting on askscience and reddit in general this has gone better than it could have. next an apology. i was originally thinking of posting these questions in one of the atheism debate religion or philosophy subs but in the end i went with askscience because i figured there would be more experts in the relevant astronomy astrophysics physics subjects here. i arrived at these questions through my interactions with religious people on their blogs . i had never encounter a modern day geocentrist before and so was unwilling to continue discussing the points he made with the little information i had at my disposal at the time . not having ndgt's kaku's hawking's or plait's numbers on hand anymore i thought i might try to get these questions answered here. i then made the mistake of linking directly to that person's blog in my op which i am assuming is to blame for his incredibly quick arrival at this thread . i hope that the distinction is clear between my op looking for factual information about real data and theory and the person who later made an appearance here . my training is as a computer scientist and though i was contemplating copy pastaing the blog points which i eventually linked to something about the unnecessary duplication of a wall o' text verbatim is nails chalkboard to me . i realize now that there may have been unforeseen negatives to that decision which would have made it worth while to spend the time. i've noted the shocked tone of some of the original responses followed by frustration and eventually dismissal . i personally feel that any and all questions are healthy and important to ask so long as one is willing and capable of accepting the best answers provided by reason and evidence so i sympathize. whether or not this thread eventually devolved into more noise than signal is obviously up to you to decide but for my part i got some questions answered and i suppose i got to eat some popcorn while an intellectual train wreck occurred in front of me. i will attempt to collect a quick list of the information that i've learned as a result of this and post it below. </s> </s>

<s> <s> i was thinking about the possibility that we're a simulation awhile back and considered that to perfectly represent our universe if we wanted to do it we would need an immense amount of storage . the language of computers is in 1s and 0s right and so to correctly represent the universe you'd need a mechanism which represents yes no . the best i could come up with was elections which have a up or down spin with one representing 1 the other representing 0 . however in such a system the amount of electrons would be insufficient to represent the information necessary to simulate our universe assuming that the 'real' universe is the size of our universe and has the same laws of physics particles. with only electron spin though you could store only the up or down spin of the electron in the simulation so the best you could simulate is a universe with an equivalent amount of electrons but only their spin all at once . nothing about their location velocity size charge . then i realized that what i'm describing isn't really how the universe works . there's uncertainty . einstein says that god doesn't play dice and the consensus i've always seen is that he's actually wrong about that . so could things like heisenberg's uncertainty principle spooky action at a distance and electron clouds which are represented by probability functions just be data power saving measures </s> </s>

<s> <s> example: this is my own home grown theory claiming that stuff can in fact go faster than the speed of light. let's say all sorts of planetary and star like bodies in this universe are moving all over the place . we are rotating around the sun but for what it's worth our sun might be moving in relation to another body in space as well . which in turn might have some sort of speed direction in relation to another body in space . what if this would create a chain which would eventually theoretically line up perfectly and meet another chain that has lined up perfectly as well but in the other direction meet each other at the fastest point of the chain this speed of the chain would in this case be referenced to the first body which in this theory doesn't have a relevant motion. the way this all works out in my head is that theoretically those two fastest bodies would have some sort of speed . but both compared tho which reference point could you take just one of the two starting points and when they meet would it's speed effectively be zero on one of the planets and double the speed that both are moving on the other planet if so then if the chain is long enough why wouldn't they be able to reach a speed faster than light when they collide or closely pass each other in this entire story and theory i just have to get back to the point that speed is a funny thing because of reference points etc . and you could totally say it's very relative . if it's relative then how can we claim light to be the fastest thing also how do we know it's the fastest thing is it just because we just don't know of anything that is faster which would be very stupid reasoning in my book or is there some solid math behind this on a related point if galaxies are moving towards each other these would have immense speed as well but if light as the absolute highest speed what would possibly be the thing that is limiting the speed of galaxies and compared to what what could possibly be limiting a huge galaxy that is floating in nothingness </s> </s>

<s> <s> i was recently considering the precessional cycle of the earth 25 920 years and the fact that the seasons should swap at the half way point . since the earth's tilt will be completely tilted in the opposite direction every \~13k years we can expect summer to be in january in the northern hemisphere in the year 15 020 ce . however we should be able to see a continual shift in the date of the seasons as the earth's tilt precesses . so i was thinking: &#x200b 1 . half the precession of the equinox is \~13k years 2 . 13k years to shift summer to winter roughly 180 day shift of the seasons 3 . 20% of this shift would be 36 days and should take 2600 years. 4 . i think we should recognize a 36 day shift in the seasons. i tried to find some data on the summer harvest dates or seasonal changes but i haven't found anything yet . i found a reference in robert sallares book the ecology of the ancient greek world where on page 391 he says a consensus has developed among ancient historians that the climate of greece in the fifth and fourth centuries bce was virtually identical to the present day climate. this would suggest that the precession of the earth's axis has no effect on the seasons . that doesn't make sense . so i was wondering anyone has any data or knows of any paper on this topic. thank you. </s> </s>

<s> <s> so in statistics i understand that given a 1% chance of success it will take an average of 68.something attempts to succeed because the equation is .99^x = .5 and you solve for x . however does that mean that the average attempts to get say 1 000 successes at a 1% rate would be ~68 000 on one hand it makes sense that you would just multiply the average attempts by the number of successes necessary . however looking at it from the standpoint of common sense a 1 100 chance times 1 000 necessary successes should just be 1001 000 . which number is correct if either and why thanks in advance edit for further clarification i'm basically asking a question that's an extension of this if i attempt something with 1 probability old reddit post . if .99^100 = x and x is about .64 then you can just substitute x for number of attempts instead of probability and thus find the average number of attempts in order to have any given chance of success correct that is .99^x = .5 so x =68.9676 . this seems to assert that after about 69 attempts you would have a 50% chance of success . so why doesn't that translate into chance of having a certain number of successes within a certain number of attempts or why is this number not 100 since intuitively it should take an average of 100 attempts to succeed given a 1% chance of success </s> </s>

<s> <s> i have observed that whenever questions about evolution and natural selection come up here or in other contexts people providing answers are often quick to point out that randomly occuring mutations are responsible and required for introducing new or modified features in organisms that are then selected for or against determining the likelihood rate of that mutation surviving in the gene pool. however as an interested layperson my knowledge about evolutionary biology and genetics is mostly based on biology class back in school and on reading popular science like dawkins sagan bryson my intuitive understanding of evolution and natural selection makes me believe that the main driving force behind the changes needed to keep evolution going is merely the genetic variation occuring naturally due to sexual reproduction when the genes of two individuals are shuffeled and recombined . sure the occasional spontaneous mutation is needed as some sort of catalyst speeding things up and introducing radical changes that might turn out successful or not . but overall mutations are by far not the main cause behind genetic modifications required for evolution most of those are covered by standard genetic variation. now i'm wondering how accurate is that intuitive understanding of mine are there any numbers   estimates about how much influcence mutations have on the variety of the gene pool as opposed to the variation already provided by sexual reproduction </s> </s>

<s> <s> hello me and a friend were just watching some vids about time dilation and me and my buddy are trying to figure out where our logic is wrong here so it would be great to see what we are missing. understandings: when moving at the speed of light away from a clock the clock would be perceived as 'frozen' to the travelling person's eyes. what i don't understand about this is that from what i know the way the eye works is that light must hit the retina for my brain to perceive an image . but surely if i'm moving away at the same speed the light is both constant speeds then the first bit of light might hit my eye but after that there is no distance being made between the light and my eye since both are the same constant speed for example 2 cars travelling in front of each other in the same direction at the same speed would never actually hit . surely nothing would be hitting my eye anymore. what am i missing here i have heard a lot that time dilation is just perspective just like when i mentioned above time seemed to be frozen due to moving away from the clock at the speed of light. what i also don't get about this is that time 'seems' to be frozen however this is just because the light is not given the chance to hit my retina surely that's just a visual effect . i have heard that time dilation could theoretically affect how you would age compared to another perspective but i just don't see how that is the case since everything is to do with 'perspective'. surely travelling away from that clock at the speed of light doesn't actually stop time for me as an observer it just stops me seeing the light coming off of it which tells me the clock is ticking . when i return back to earth everything would have aged the same amount as me any comments or clarifications would be awesome neither of us study or work in scientific fields so i'm not sure if there is a relatively simple way of explaining this but again any help would be really appreciated </s> </s>

<s> <s> i think i've heard that the reason older people and animals get sick more often is that their dna decays over time and causes nore mistakes when it tries to replicate itself over time . so why doesn't the same thing happen to babies how do they get fresh dna from older peoples' adult dna </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was looking at a map of tectonic plate boundaries and the antarctic plate seems to be diverging from all the plates around it . does this mean there has to be a convergent boundary at the northern portions of almost all the other plates because they're all being pushed north is the antarctic plate moving or mostly standing still does one side push harder than the other does it switch back and forth depending on geologic activity </s> </s>

<s> <s> ive read the very basics about the immune system primary response learned secondary response . as i understand it most symptoms you feel while sick come from your immune system itself . but when you have a mild symptoms eg . due to covid while vaccinated does this mean your primary immune response is taking care of it or is it the learned t   b cells antibodies immune system taking care of it if it is the secondary response taking care of it what determines whether you have strong symptoms vs . mild symptoms </s> </s>

<s> <s> if the nearest galaxy is 250k light years away i understand that by the time that light reaches us and we observe that galaxy we're actually seeing it as it was 250k years ago . but why does this translate to this galaxy being 250k years in the past why can't we say that something happens simultaneously in our galaxy and that one but they won't be observed for 250k+ years if there was some way to observe both galaxies at the same time wouldn't everything happen simultaneously </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was wandering around youtube the other night and saw this video but it doesn't fully explain how the excess length of the nerve is managed . i know you can cut blood vessels and reattach them shorter but does this work like that or do the doctors spool it up around the bone or something thanks. edit spelling </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems like the dust from supernovae shouldn't collect in clumps of similar atoms but settle fairly uniformly across gravitational bodies they encounter . at most i'd expect supernovae elements to be found in fairly even thin layers about any gravitational object but instead we find ores . how does a streak of say mostly iron end up in our crust or on an asteroid are they believed to be the result of fe rich asteroids or is there a mechanism that makes the fe atoms clump together in the magma of a young planet </s> </s>

<s> <s> i mean metal alloys are mixtures of several elements and sometimes have two or more metallic elements . wouldn't galvanic corrosion affect this alloy on its own as there are dissimilar metals bonus question i just thought of we know how to calculate the galvanic index etc between two metal elements via their electronegativity anodic potential etc. . how do we do that for alloys for rough example an alloy of 90%iron 10%tin that is in contact with copper do we do weighted average for the alloy in comparison with the other dissimilar metal </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on one hand i could see the rate slowing down if most of the easy to reach sites had been found and as development paves and builds over more land making it inaccessible. on the other hand i could see it speeding up as more building projects break more ground or as more scientists enter these fields worldwide. what i'm really getting at i suppose is.. . do we have any sense of what the future holds is it an exciting time in archaeology peleontology or should we expect that the best finds are behind us with the exception of an occasional big discovery is there any way to know related are there any mathematical models related to this question similar to how peak oil theories try to predict how much oil can be feasibly reached </s> </s>
