Implementation of common ML algorithms in Numpy or Pytorch. This is purley for educational purposes. All notebooks should run propely. I tried my best to implement most of the following models from scratch using numpy or pytroch. 

### Models and Algorithms

### Regression

    * Linear regression   

           Linear_Regression.ipynb , Linear and Non-Linear Regression Pytorch.ipynb

    * Logistic regression 

            Logistic_Regression.ipynb , Logistic_Regression_SimpleNN_Pytorch.ipynb , Logistic_Regression_Pytorch.ipynb
### Trees 
            
    * Decision tree and Random forest algorithm

        decision_tree-random-forest-pytorch.ipynb
        
    * Gradient Boosting algorithm

            gradient_boosting-pytorch.ipynb 
            
### SVM 
        
    * SVM algorithm

            svm-pytorch.ipynb
            
### Naive Bayes

    * Naive Bayes algorithm

            Naive Bayes.ipynb
            
### KNN

    * RNN  

            TBD

    * CNN 

            TBD
        
### Tasks 

    * Text Classification

    * Building a Recommendation System

            Recommendation.ipynb

I used ChatGPT to create definition of the model. You can see the snapshots added to the notebooks. In some cases I used ChatGPT to generate part of the code as well.
